# Symbol Text Link Format (STLF) Specification
The purpose of this specification is to define a common format for pairing images and text within common document types, particularly slide, word processing, and publishing document types.

Example document types:
* PowerPoint (on any platform)
* Google Slides
* Presentation documents from other providers
* Microsoft Word, Google Docs etc.

The idea is that by having a common format, any software that operates on standard document types - whether that be via a plug-in to existing software, or a separate piece of software - can recognise symbols and what text those symbols refer to, even if the symbols have been added using software from a different provider.
